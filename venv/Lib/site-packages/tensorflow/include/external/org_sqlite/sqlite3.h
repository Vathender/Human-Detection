** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()],
** that allows an application to run multiple statements of SQL
** without having to use a lot of C code.
**
** ^The sqlite3_exec() interface runs zero or more UTF-8 encoded,
** semicolon-separate SQL statements passed into its 2nd argument,
** in the context of the [database connection] passed in as its 1st
** argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is not NULL, then it is invoked for each result row
** coming out of the evaluated SQL statements.  ^The 4th argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
** callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite3_exec()
** is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
** ignored.
**
** ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
** sqlite3_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
** subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec()
** is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] and passed back through the 5th parameter.
** To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite3_free()]
** on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
** sqlite3_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
** ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec() is not NULL and no errors
** occur, then sqlite3_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
** NULL before returning.
**
** ^If an sqlite3_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite3_exec()
** routine returns SQLITE_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
** without running any subsequent SQL statements.
**
** ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite3_exec() callback function is the
** number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite3_exec()
** callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
** [sqlite3_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
** result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
** entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
** from [sqlite3_column_name()].
**
** ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite3_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
** to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or
** SQL comments, then no SQL statements are evaluated and the database
** is not changed.
**

**
** <ul>
** <li> The application must ensure that the 1st parameter to sqlite3_exec()
**      is a valid and open [database connection].
** <li> The application must not close the [database connection] specified by

**      the 2nd parameter of sqlite3_exec() while sqlite3_exec() is running.

** CAPI3REF: OS Interface File Virtual Methods Object
**
** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
** [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
** may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
** only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
** is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to NULL.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
** A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
** return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
** recognize.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:

** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_BATCH_ATOMIC]
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of

** first then the size of the file is extended, never the other

** to xWrite().
**
** If xRead() returns SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ it must also fill
** in the unread portions of the buffer with zeros.  A VFS that

/*
** CAPI3REF: Standard File Control Opcodes
** KEYWORDS: {file control opcodes} {file control opcode}
**
** These integer constants are opcodes for the xFileControl method
** of the [sqlite3_io_methods] object and for the [sqlite3_file_control()]
** interface.
**
** <ul>
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to write the current state of
** the lock (one of [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE], [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED], [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE])
** into an integer that the pArg argument points to. This capability
** is used during testing and is only available when the SQLITE_TEST
** compile-time option is used.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT] opcode is used by SQLite to give the VFS
** layer a hint of how large the database file will grow to be during the
** current transaction.  This hint is not guaranteed to be accurate but it
** is often close.  The underlying VFS might choose to preallocate database
** file space based on this hint in order to help writes to the database
** file run faster.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_LIMIT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_LIMIT] opcode is used by in-memory VFS that
** implements [sqlite3_deserialize()] to set an upper bound on the size
** of the in-memory database.  The argument is a pointer to a [sqlite3_int64].
** If the integer pointed to is negative, then it is filled in with the
** current limit.  Otherwise the limit is set to the larger of the value
** of the integer pointed to and the current database size.  The integer
** pointed to is set to the new limit.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE] opcode is used to request that the VFS
** extends and truncates the database file in chunks of a size specified
** by the user. The fourth argument to [sqlite3_file_control()] should
** point to an integer (type int) containing the new chunk-size to use
** for the nominated database. Allocating database file space in large
** chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and
** improve performance on some systems.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with a particular database
** connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with the journal file (either
** the [rollback journal] or the [write-ahead log]) for a particular database
** connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED]]
** No longer in use.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC] opcode is generated internally by SQLite and
** sent to the VFS immediately before the xSync method is invoked on a
** database file descriptor. Or, if the xSync method is not invoked
** because the user has configured SQLite with
** [PRAGMA synchronous | PRAGMA synchronous=OFF] it is invoked in place
** of the xSync method. In most cases, the pointer argument passed with
** this file-control is NULL. However, if the database file is being synced
** as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated
** string containing the transactions super-journal file name. VFSes that
** do not need this signal should silently ignore this opcode. Applications
** should not call [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may
** disrupt the operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO] opcode is generated internally by SQLite
** and sent to the VFS after a transaction has been committed immediately
** but before the database is unlocked. VFSes that do not need this signal
** should silently ignore this opcode. Applications should not call
** [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may disrupt the
** operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY] opcode is used to configure automatic
** retry counts and intervals for certain disk I/O operations for the
** windows [VFS] in order to provide robustness in the presence of
** anti-virus programs.  By default, the windows VFS will retry file read,
** file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay
** of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing
** by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.  This
** opcode allows these two values (10 retries and 25 milliseconds of delay)
** to be adjusted.  The values are changed for all database connections
** within the same process.  The argument is a pointer to an array of two
** integers where the first integer is the new retry count and the second
** integer is the delay.  If either integer is negative, then the setting
** is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written
** into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be
** interrogated.  The zDbName parameter is ignored.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent [WAL | Write Ahead Log] setting.  By default, the auxiliary
** write ahead log ([WAL file]) and shared memory
** files used for transaction control
** are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database
** closes.  Setting persistent WAL mode causes those files to persist after
** close.  Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not
** have write permission on the directory containing the database file want
** to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist
** in order for the database to be readable.  The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent
** WAL mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** WAL persistence setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent "powersafe-overwrite" or "PSOW" setting.  The PSOW setting
** determines the [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] bit of the
** xDeviceCharacteristics methods. The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage
** mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** zero-damage mode setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE] opcode is invoked by SQLite after opening
** a write transaction to indicate that, unless it is rolled back for some
** reason, the entire database file will be overwritten by the current
** transaction. This is used by VACUUM operations.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME] opcode can be used to obtain the names of
** all [VFSes] in the VFS stack.  The names are of all VFS shims and the
** final bottom-level VFS are written into memory obtained from
** [sqlite3_malloc()] and the result is stored in the char* variable
** that the fourth parameter of [sqlite3_file_control()] points to.
** The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when done.  As with
** all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually
** do anything.  Callers should initialize the char* variable to a NULL
** pointer in case this file-control is not implemented.  This file-control
** is intended for diagnostic use only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER] opcode finds a pointer to the top-level
** [VFSes] currently in use.  ^(The argument X in
** sqlite3_file_control(db,SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER,X) must be
** of type "[sqlite3_vfs] **".  This opcodes will set *X
** to a pointer to the top-level VFS.)^
** ^When there are multiple VFS shims in the stack, this opcode finds the
** upper-most shim only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]]
** ^Whenever a [PRAGMA] statement is parsed, an [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control is sent to the open [sqlite3_file] object corresponding
** to the database file to which the pragma statement refers. ^The argument
** to the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control is an array of
** pointers to strings (char**) in which the second element of the array
** is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the
** pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.  ^The handler for an
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control can optionally make the first element
** of the char** argument point to a string obtained from [sqlite3_mprintf()]
** or the equivalent and that string will become the result of the pragma or
** the error message if the pragma fails. ^If the
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], then normal
** [PRAGMA] processing continues.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control returns [SQLITE_OK], then the parser assumes that the
** VFS has handled the PRAGMA itself and the parser generates a no-op
** prepared statement if result string is NULL, or that returns a copy
** of the result string if the string is non-NULL.
** ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns
** any result code other than [SQLITE_OK] or [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], that means
** that the VFS encountered an error while handling the [PRAGMA] and the
** compilation of the PRAGMA fails with an error.  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control occurs at the beginning of pragma statement analysis and so
** it is able to override built-in [PRAGMA] statements.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]
** file-control may be invoked by SQLite on the database file handle
** shortly after it is opened in order to provide a custom VFS with access
** to the connection's busy-handler callback. The argument is of type (void**)
** - an array of two (void *) values. The first (void *) actually points
** to a function of type (int (*)(void *)). In order to invoke the connection's
** busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in
** the array as the only argument. If it returns non-zero, then the operation
** should be retried. If it returns zero, the custom VFS should abandon the
** current operation.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME]]
** ^Applications can invoke the [SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME] file-control
** to have SQLite generate a
** temporary filename using the same algorithm that is followed to generate
** temporary filenames for TEMP tables and other internal uses.  The
** argument should be a char** which will be filled with the filename

** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
** interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
** a floating point value.
** ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
** Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in
** a 24-hour day).
** ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
** date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or
** greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
** to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
**

** CAPI3REF: Initialize The SQLite Library
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the
** SQLite library.  ^The sqlite3_shutdown() routine
** deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
** These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and
** shutdown on embedded systems.  Workstation applications using
** SQLite normally do not need to invoke either of these routines.
**
** A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
** the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
** the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
** following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  ^(Only an effective call
** of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
** are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first
** call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize().  ^(Only
** an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization.
** All other valid calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() interface is threadsafe, but sqlite3_shutdown()
** is not.  The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a
** single thread.  All open [database connections] must be closed and all
** other SQLite resources must be deallocated prior to invoking
** sqlite3_shutdown().
**
** Among other things, ^sqlite3_initialize() will invoke
** sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, ^sqlite3_shutdown()
** will invoke sqlite3_os_end().
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
** ^If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
** the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
** as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
** SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
** invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
** calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
** initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
** already.  ^However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
** compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
** are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
** prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
** it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
** directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
** of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
** when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
** default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
** initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
** routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
** performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
** of static resources, initialization of global variables,
** setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
** a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
**
** The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
** or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
** sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
** interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
** sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
** implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
** are built into SQLite when it is compiled for Unix, Windows, or OS/2.
** When [custom builds | built for other platforms]
** (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time
** option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for
** sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().  An application-supplied
** implementation of sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end()
** must return [SQLITE_OK] on success and some other [error code] upon
** failure.

** Note, however, that ^sqlite3_config() can be called as part of the
** implementation of an application-defined [sqlite3_os_init()].
**

** what property of SQLite is to be configured.  Subsequent arguments

/*
** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Routines
**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between SQLite
** and low-level memory allocation routines.
**
** This object is used in only one place in the SQLite interface.
** A pointer to an instance of this object is the argument to
** [sqlite3_config()] when the configuration option is
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMALLOC].
** By creating an instance of this object
** and passing it to [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC])
** during configuration, an application can specify an alternative
** memory allocation subsystem for SQLite to use for all of its
** dynamic memory needs.
**
** Note that SQLite comes with several [built-in memory allocators]
** that are perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications
** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
** malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
** ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
** xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
** Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite3_malloc()]
** or [sqlite3_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0,
** that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  For example,
** it might allocate any required mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite3_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to
** xInit and xShutdown.
**
** SQLite holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MAIN] mutex when it invokes
** the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
** holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
** it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
** However, if [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
** methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
** serialization.
**
** SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().

** of a table column that its values are likely to be very large - larger
** than the configured sorter-reference size threshold - then a reference
** is stored in each sorted record and the required column values loaded
** from the database as records are returned in sorted order. The default

** names are not also used by explicitly declared columns. ^If
** the table has a column of type [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY] then that column
** is another alias for the rowid.
**
** ^The sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) interface usually returns the [rowid] of
** the most recent successful [INSERT] into a rowid table or [virtual table]
** on database connection D. ^Inserts into [WITHOUT ROWID] tables are not
** recorded. ^If no successful [INSERT]s into rowid tables have ever occurred
** on the database connection D, then sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) returns
** zero.
**
** As well as being set automatically as rows are inserted into database
** tables, the value returned by this function may be set explicitly by
** [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()]
**
** Some virtual table implementations may INSERT rows into rowid tables as
** part of committing a transaction (e.g. to flush data accumulated in memory
** to disk). In this case subsequent calls to this function return the rowid
** associated with these internal INSERT operations, which leads to
** unintuitive results. Virtual table implementations that do write to rowid
** tables in this way can avoid this problem by restoring the original
** rowid value using [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()] before returning
** control to the user.
**
** ^(If an [INSERT] occurs within a trigger then this routine will
** return the [rowid] of the inserted row as long as the trigger is
** running. Once the trigger program ends, the value returned
** by this routine reverts to what it was before the trigger was fired.)^
**
** ^An [INSERT] that fails due to a constraint violation is not a
** successful [INSERT] and does not change the value returned by this
** routine.  ^Thus INSERT OR FAIL, INSERT OR IGNORE, INSERT OR ROLLBACK,
** and INSERT OR ABORT make no changes to the return value of this

** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility.
** Use of this interface is not recommended.
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** ^(As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two columns (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array named azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter and returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(),
** it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to
** release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the

** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Subsystem
**
** The SQLite core uses these three routines for all of its own
** internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
** does not include operating-system specific [VFS] implementation.  The
** Windows VFS uses native malloc() and free() for some operations.
**
** ^The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
** of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
** ^If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
** memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  ^If the parameter N to
** sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** ^The sqlite3_malloc64(N) routine works just like
** sqlite3_malloc(N) except that N is an unsigned 64-bit integer instead
** of a signed 32-bit integer.
**
** ^Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  ^The sqlite3_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
**
** ^The sqlite3_realloc(X,N) interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation X to be at least N bytes.
** ^If the X parameter to sqlite3_realloc(X,N)
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite3_malloc(N).
** ^If the N parameter to sqlite3_realloc(X,N) is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(X).
** ^sqlite3_realloc(X,N) returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if insufficient memory is available.
** ^If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite3_realloc(X,N) and the prior allocation is freed.
** ^If sqlite3_realloc(X,N) returns NULL and N is positive, then the
** prior allocation is not freed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_realloc64(X,N) interfaces works the same as
** sqlite3_realloc(X,N) except that N is a 64-bit unsigned integer instead
** of a 32-bit signed integer.
**
** ^If X is a memory allocation previously obtained from sqlite3_malloc(),
** sqlite3_malloc64(), sqlite3_realloc(), or sqlite3_realloc64(), then
** sqlite3_msize(X) returns the size of that memory allocation in bytes.
** ^The value returned by sqlite3_msize(X) might be larger than the number
** of bytes requested when X was allocated.  ^If X is a NULL pointer then
** sqlite3_msize(X) returns zero.  If X points to something that is not
** the beginning of memory allocation, or if it points to a formerly
** valid memory allocation that has now been freed, then the behavior
** of sqlite3_msize(X) is undefined and possibly harmful.
**
** ^The memory returned by sqlite3_malloc(), sqlite3_realloc(),
** sqlite3_malloc64(), and sqlite3_realloc64()
** is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary, or to a
** 4 byte boundary if the [SQLITE_4_BYTE_ALIGNED_MALLOC] compile-time

** CAPI3REF: Compile-Time Authorization Callbacks
** METHOD: sqlite3
** KEYWORDS: {authorizer callback}
**
** ^This routine registers an authorizer callback with a particular
** [database connection], supplied in the first argument.
** ^The authorizer callback is invoked as SQL statements are being compiled
** by [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants [sqlite3_prepare_v2()],
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()], [sqlite3_prepare16()], [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()],
** and [sqlite3_prepare16_v3()].  ^At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
** to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
** see if those actions are allowed.  ^The authorizer callback should
** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.  ^If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
** then the [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
** the authorizer will fail with an error message.
**
** When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
** requested is ok.  ^When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
** authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
** access is denied.
**
** ^The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
** parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. ^The second parameter
** to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
** the particular action to be authorized. ^The third through sixth parameters
** to the callback are either NULL pointers or zero-terminated strings
** that contain additional details about the action to be authorized.
** Applications must always be prepared to encounter a NULL pointer in any
** of the third through the sixth parameters of the authorization callback.
**
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
** ^When a table is referenced by a [SELECT] but no column values are
** extracted from that table (for example in a query like
** "SELECT count(*) FROM tab") then the [SQLITE_READ] authorizer callback
** is invoked once for that table with a column name that is an empty string.
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_DELETE] and the callback returns
** [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
** [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.)^  ^Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
** Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
**
** ^When [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be re-prepared during [sqlite3_step()] due to a
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite3_step()].
**
** ^Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
** performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite3_step()], unless
** as stated in the previous paragraph, sqlite3_step() invokes
** sqlite3_prepare_v2() to reprepare a statement after a schema change.

** </dd>)^
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX]</dt>
** <dd>The new database connection will use the "multi-thread"

**
** ^If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database

**
** ^If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary

** automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
**
** [[URI filenames in sqlite3_open()]] <h3>URI Filenames</h3>
**
** ^If [URI filename] interpretation is enabled, and the filename argument
** begins with "file:", then the filename is interpreted as a URI. ^URI
** filename interpretation is enabled if the [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] flag is
** set in the third argument to sqlite3_open_v2(), or if it has
** been enabled globally using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_URI] option with the
** [sqlite3_config()] method or by the [SQLITE_USE_URI] compile-time option.
** URI filename interpretation is turned off
** by default, but future releases of SQLite might enable URI filename
** interpretation by default.  See "[URI filenames]" for additional
** information.
**
** URI filenames are parsed according to RFC 3986. ^If the URI contains an
** authority, then it must be either an empty string or the string
** "localhost". ^If the authority is not an empty string or "localhost", an
** error is returned to the caller. ^The fragment component of a URI, if
** present, is ignored.
**
** ^SQLite uses the path component of the URI as the name of the disk file
** which contains the database. ^If the path begins with a '/' character,
** then it is interpreted as an absolute path. ^If the path does not begin
** with a '/' (meaning that the authority section is omitted from the URI)
** then the path is interpreted as a relative path.
** ^(On windows, the first component of an absolute path
** is a drive specification (e.g. "C:").)^
**
** [[core URI query parameters]]
** The query component of a URI may contain parameters that are interpreted
** either by SQLite itself, or by a [VFS | custom VFS implementation].
** SQLite and its built-in [VFSes] interpret the
** following query parameters:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> <b>vfs</b>: ^The "vfs" parameter may be used to specify the name of
**     a VFS object that provides the operating system interface that should
**     be used to access the database file on disk. ^If this option is set to
**     an empty string the default VFS object is used. ^Specifying an unknown
**     VFS is an error. ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the vfs option is
**     present, then the VFS specified by the option takes precedence over
**     the value passed as the fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>mode</b>: ^(The mode parameter may be set to either "ro", "rw",
**     "rwc", or "memory". Attempting to set it to any other value is
**     an error)^.
**     ^If "ro" is specified, then the database is opened for read-only
**     access, just as if the [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY] flag had been set in the
**     third argument to sqlite3_open_v2(). ^If the mode option is set to
**     "rw", then the database is opened for read-write (but not create)
**     access, as if SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE (but not SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE) had
**     been set. ^Value "rwc" is equivalent to setting both
**     SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE and SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE.  ^If the mode option is
**     set to "memory" then a pure [in-memory database] that never reads
**     or writes from disk is used. ^It is an error to specify a value for
**     the mode parameter that is less restrictive than that specified by
**     the flags passed in the third parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>cache</b>: ^The cache parameter may be set to either "shared" or
**     "private". ^Setting it to "shared" is equivalent to setting the
**     SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE bit in the flags argument passed to
**     sqlite3_open_v2(). ^Setting the cache parameter to "private" is
**     equivalent to setting the SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE bit.
**     ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the "cache" parameter is present in
**     a URI filename, its value overrides any behavior requested by setting
**     SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE or SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE flag.
**
**  <li> <b>psow</b>: ^The psow parameter indicates whether or not the
**     [powersafe overwrite] property does or does not apply to the
**     storage media on which the database file resides.
**
**  <li> <b>nolock</b>: ^The nolock parameter is a boolean query parameter
**     which if set disables file locking in rollback journal modes.  This
**     is useful for accessing a database on a filesystem that does not
**     support locking.  Caution:  Database corruption might result if two
**     or more processes write to the same database and any one of those
**     processes uses nolock=1.
**
**  <li> <b>immutable</b>: ^The immutable parameter is a boolean query
**     parameter that indicates that the database file is stored on
**     read-only media.  ^When immutable is set, SQLite assumes that the
**     database file cannot be changed, even by a process with higher
**     privilege, and so the database is opened read-only and all locking
**     and change detection is disabled.  Caution: Setting the immutable
**     property on a database file that does in fact change can result
**     in incorrect query results and/or [SQLITE_CORRUPT] errors.
**     See also: [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE].
**
** </ul>
**
** ^Specifying an unknown parameter in the query component of a URI is not an
** error.  Future versions of SQLite might understand additional query
** parameters.  See "[query parameters with special meaning to SQLite]" for
** additional information.

** CAPI3REF: Obtain Values For URI Parameters
**
** These are utility routines, useful to [VFS|custom VFS implementations],
** that check if a database file was a URI that contained a specific query
** parameter, and if so obtains the value of that query parameter.
**
** The first parameter to these interfaces (hereafter referred to
** as F) must be one of:
** <ul>
** <li> A database filename pointer created by the SQLite core and
** passed into the xOpen() method of a VFS implemention, or
** <li> A filename obtained from [sqlite3_db_filename()], or
** <li> A new filename constructed using [sqlite3_create_filename()].
** </ul>
** If the F parameter is not one of the above, then the behavior is
** undefined and probably undesirable.  Older versions of SQLite were
** more tolerant of invalid F parameters than newer versions.
**
** If F is a suitable filename (as described in the previous paragraph)
** and if P is the name of the query parameter, then
** sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns the value of the P
** parameter if it exists or a NULL pointer if P does not appear as a
** query parameter on F.  If P is a query parameter of F and it
** has no explicit value, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns
** a pointer to an empty string.
**
** The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine assumes that P is a boolean
** parameter and returns true (1) or false (0) according to the value
** of P.  The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine returns true (1) if the
** value of query parameter P is one of "yes", "true", or "on" in any
** case or if the value begins with a non-zero number.  The
** sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routines returns false (0) if the value of
** query parameter P is one of "no", "false", or "off" in any case or
** if the value begins with a numeric zero.  If P is not a query
** parameter on F or if the value of P does not match any of the
** above, then sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns (B!=0).
**
** The sqlite3_uri_int64(F,P,D) routine converts the value of P into a
** 64-bit signed integer and returns that integer, or D if P does not
** exist.  If the value of P is something other than an integer, then
** zero is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_uri_key(F,N) returns a pointer to the name (not
** the value) of the N-th query parameter for filename F, or a NULL
** pointer if N is less than zero or greater than the number of query
** parameters minus 1.  The N value is zero-based so N should be 0 to obtain
** the name of the first query parameter, 1 for the second parameter, and
** so forth.
**
** If F is a NULL pointer, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns NULL and
** sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns B.  If F is not a NULL pointer and
** is not a database file pathname pointer that the SQLite core passed
** into the xOpen VFS method, then the behavior of this routine is undefined
** and probably undesirable.
**
** Beginning with SQLite [version 3.31.0] ([dateof:3.31.0]) the input F
** parameter can also be the name of a rollback journal file or WAL file
** in addition to the main database file.  Prior to version 3.31.0, these
** routines would only work if F was the name of the main database file.
** When the F parameter is the name of the rollback journal or WAL file,
** it has access to all the same query parameters as were found on the
** main database file.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
** METHOD: sqlite3
** CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3_stmt
**
** To execute an SQL statement, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.  Or, in other words, these routines
** are constructors for the [prepared statement] object.
**
** The preferred routine to use is [sqlite3_prepare_v2()].  The
** [sqlite3_prepare()] interface is legacy and should be avoided.
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()] has an extra "prepFlags" option that is used
** for special purposes.
**
** The use of the UTF-8 interfaces is preferred, as SQLite currently
** does all parsing using UTF-8.  The UTF-16 interfaces are provided
** as a convenience.  The UTF-16 interfaces work by converting the
** input text into UTF-8, then invoking the corresponding UTF-8 interface.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare(), sqlite3_prepare_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare_v3()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16(), sqlite3_prepare16_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare16_v3() use UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is negative, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. ^If nByte is positive, then it is the
** number of bytes read from zSql.  ^If nByte is zero, then no prepared
** statement is generated.
** If the caller knows that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then
** there is a small performance advantage to passing an nByte parameter that
** is the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator.
**
** ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** ^*ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  ^If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** ^On success, the sqlite3_prepare() family of routines return [SQLITE_OK];
** otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2(), sqlite3_prepare_v3(), sqlite3_prepare16_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare16_v3() interfaces are recommended for all new programs.
** The older interfaces (sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare16())
** are retained for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** ^In the "vX" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave differently in three ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** ^If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again. As many as [SQLITE_MAX_SCHEMA_RETRY]
** retries will occur before sqlite3_step() gives up and returns an error.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
** [error codes] or [extended error codes].  ^The legacy behavior was that
** [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
** and the application would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()]
** in order to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
** interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^If the specific value bound to a [parameter | host parameter] in the
** WHERE clause might influence the choice of query plan for a statement,
** then the statement will be automatically recompiled, as if there had been
** a schema change, on the first [sqlite3_step()] call following any change
** to the [sqlite3_bind_text | bindings] of that [parameter].
** ^The specific value of a WHERE-clause [parameter] might influence the
** choice of query plan if the parameter is the left-hand side of a [LIKE]
** or [GLOB] operator or if the parameter is compared to an indexed column
** and the [SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4] compile-time option is enabled.
** </li>
** </ol>
**
** <p>^sqlite3_prepare_v3() differs from sqlite3_prepare_v2() only in having
** the extra prepFlags parameter, which is a bit array consisting of zero or
** more of the [SQLITE_PREPARE_PERSISTENT|SQLITE_PREPARE_*] flags.  ^The
** sqlite3_prepare_v2() interface works exactly the same as
** sqlite3_prepare_v3() with a zero prepFlags parameter.

**
** ^The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines is always
** a pointer to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or its variants.
**
** ^The second argument is the index of the SQL parameter to be set.
** ^The leftmost SQL parameter has an index of 1.  ^When the same named
** SQL parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.
** ^The index for named parameters can be looked up using the

** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** ^The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite3_limit()]
** parameter [SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER] (default value: 32766).
**
** ^The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_bind_text() or sqlite3_bind_text16()
** or sqlite3_bind_blob() is a NULL pointer then the fourth parameter
** is ignored and the end result is the same as sqlite3_bind_null().
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_bind_text() is not NULL, then
** it should be a pointer to well-formed UTF8 text.
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_bind_text16() is not NULL, then
** it should be a pointer to well-formed UTF16 text.
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_bind_text64() is not NULL, then
** it should be a pointer to a well-formed unicode string that is
** either UTF8 if the sixth parameter is SQLITE_UTF8, or UTF16
** otherwise.
**
** [[byte-order determination rules]] ^The byte-order of

** ^If UTF16 input text contains invalid unicode
** characters, then SQLite might change those invalid characters

** ^(In those routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the

** ^If the fourth parameter to sqlite3_bind_text() or sqlite3_bind_text16()

** contain embedded NULs.  The result of expressions involving strings
** with embedded NULs is undefined.
**
** ^The fifth argument to the BLOB and string binding interfaces
** is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or

** except the destructor is not called if the third parameter is a NULL
** pointer or the fourth parameter is negative.
** ^If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** ^If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite3_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** ^The sixth argument to sqlite3_bind_text64() must be one of
** [SQLITE_UTF8], [SQLITE_UTF16], [SQLITE_UTF16BE], or [SQLITE_UTF16LE]
** to specify the encoding of the text in the third parameter.  If
** the sixth argument to sqlite3_bind_text64() is not one of the
** allowed values shown above, or if the text encoding is different
** from the encoding specified by the sixth parameter, then the behavior
** is undefined.
**
** ^The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
** is filled with zeroes.  ^A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold its size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as placeholders for BLOBs whose
** content is later written using
** [sqlite3_blob_open | incremental BLOB I/O] routines.
** ^A negative value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
**
** ^The sqlite3_bind_pointer(S,I,P,T,D) routine causes the I-th parameter in
** [prepared statement] S to have an SQL value of NULL, but to also be
** associated with the pointer P of type T.  ^D is either a NULL pointer or
** a pointer to a destructor function for P. ^SQLite will invoke the

**
** ^Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.

** interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] or [sqlite3_prepare16()], this function
** must be called one or more times to evaluate the statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of the sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "vX" interfaces
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()], [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_prepare16_v3()],
** [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "vX" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** ^In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY],
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** ^With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
** [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
**
** ^[SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  ^If the statement is a [COMMIT]
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within an
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** ^[SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** ^If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** ^[SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** ^With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  ^In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] was required after sqlite3_step() returned anything
** other than [SQLITE_ROW] before any subsequent invocation of
** sqlite3_step().  Failure to reset the prepared statement using
** [sqlite3_reset()] would result in an [SQLITE_MISUSE] return from
** sqlite3_step().  But after [version 3.6.23.1] ([dateof:3.6.23.1],
** sqlite3_step() began
** calling [sqlite3_reset()] automatically in this circumstance rather
** than returning [SQLITE_MISUSE].  This is not considered a compatibility
** break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error
** is broken by definition.  The [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET] compile-time option
** can be used to restore the legacy behavior.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()
** API always returns a generic error code, [SQLITE_ERROR], following any
** error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
** [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using [sqlite3_prepare_v3()] or [sqlite3_prepare_v2()]
** or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v3()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()] interfaces,

**
** <b>Details:</b>
**
** ^These routines return information about a single column of the current
** result row of a query.  ^In every case the first argument is a pointer
** to the [prepared statement] that is being evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*]
** that was returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants)
** and the second argument is the index of the column for which information
** should be returned. ^The leftmost column of the result set has the index 0.
** ^The number of columns in the result can be determined using
** [sqlite3_column_count()].
**
** If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] have been called subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.
**
** The first six interfaces (_blob, _double, _int, _int64, _text, and _text16)
** each return the value of a result column in a specific data format.  If
** the result column is not initially in the requested format (for example,
** if the query returns an integer but the sqlite3_column_text() interface
** is used to extract the value) then an automatic type conversion is performed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns the
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  ^The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].
** The return value of sqlite3_column_type() can be used to decide which
** of the first six interface should be used to extract the column value.
** The value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no
** automatic type conversions have occurred for the value in question.
** After a type conversion, the result of calling sqlite3_column_type()
** is undefined, though harmless.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or a TEXT string, then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** or sqlite3_column_bytes16() interfaces can be used to determine the size
** of that BLOB or string.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** ^If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes() returns zero.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-16 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes16()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** ^If the result is a UTF-8 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() converts
** the string to UTF-16 and then returns the number of bytes.
** ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes16() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-16 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() returns zero.
**
** ^The values returned by [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and
** [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] do not include the zero terminators at the end
** of the string.  ^For clarity: the values returned by
** [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] are the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** ^Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero-terminated.  ^The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length BLOB is a NULL pointer.
**
** <b>Warning:</b> ^The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  In a multithreaded environment,
** an unprotected sqlite3_value object may only be used safely with
** [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
** If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
** to routines like [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_bytes()], the behavior is not threadsafe.
** Hence, the sqlite3_column_value() interface
** is normally only useful within the implementation of
** [application-defined SQL functions] or [virtual tables], not within
** top-level application code.
**
** The these routines may attempt to convert the datatype of the result.
** ^For example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to perform the
** conversion automatically.  ^(The following table details the conversions
** that are applied:
**
** <blockquote>
** <table border="1">
** <tr><th> Internal<br>Type <th> Requested<br>Type <th>  Conversion
**
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td> INTEGER   <td> Result is 0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Result is 0.0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is a NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is a NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as INTEGER->TEXT
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td> INTEGER   <td> [CAST] to INTEGER
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the float
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   BLOB    <td> [CAST] to BLOB

** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>  FLOAT    <td> [CAST] to REAL
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>   BLOB    <td> No change
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td> INTEGER   <td> [CAST] to INTEGER
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>  FLOAT    <td> [CAST] to REAL
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>   TEXT    <td> Add a zero terminator if needed
** </table>
** </blockquote>)^
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>

** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
** sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or

**
** <b>Details:</b>
**
** These routines extract type, size, and content information from
** [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  Protected sqlite3_value objects
** are used to pass parameter information into the functions that
** implement [application-defined SQL functions] and [virtual tables].
**
** These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
** Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
** is not threadsafe.
**
** ^These routines work just like the corresponding [column access functions]
** except that these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object
** pointer instead of a [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** ^The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF-16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  ^The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF-16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
**
** ^If [sqlite3_value] object V was initialized
** using [sqlite3_bind_pointer(S,I,P,X,D)] or [sqlite3_result_pointer(C,P,X,D)]
** and if X and Y are strings that compare equal according to strcmp(X,Y),
** then sqlite3_value_pointer(V,Y) will return the pointer P.  ^Otherwise,
** sqlite3_value_pointer(V,Y) returns a NULL. The sqlite3_bind_pointer()
** routine is part of the [pointer passing interface] added for SQLite 3.20.0.
**
** ^(The sqlite3_value_type(V) interface returns the
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial datatype of the
** [sqlite3_value] object V. The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].)^
** Other interfaces might change the datatype for an sqlite3_value object.
** For example, if the datatype is initially SQLITE_INTEGER and
** sqlite3_value_text(V) is called to extract a text value for that
** integer, then subsequent calls to sqlite3_value_type(V) might return
** SQLITE_TEXT.  Whether or not a persistent internal datatype conversion
** occurs is undefined and may change from one release of SQLite to the next.
**
** ^(The sqlite3_value_numeric_type() interface attempts to apply
** numeric affinity to the value.  This means that an attempt is
** made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
** such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
** words, if the value is a string that looks like a number)
** then the conversion is performed.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.
** The [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype] after conversion is returned.)^
**
** ^Within the [xUpdate] method of a [virtual table], the
** sqlite3_value_nochange(X) interface returns true if and only if
** the column corresponding to X is unchanged by the UPDATE operation
** that the xUpdate method call was invoked to implement and if
** and the prior [xColumn] method call that was invoked to extracted
** the value for that column returned without setting a result (probably
** because it queried [sqlite3_vtab_nochange()] and found that the column
** was unchanging).  ^Within an [xUpdate] method, any value for which
** sqlite3_value_nochange(X) is true will in all other respects appear
** to be a NULL value.  If sqlite3_value_nochange(X) is invoked anywhere other
** than within an [xUpdate] method call for an UPDATE statement, then
** the return value is arbitrary and meaningless.
**
** ^The sqlite3_value_frombind(X) interface returns non-zero if the
** value X originated from one of the [sqlite3_bind_int|sqlite3_bind()]
** interfaces.  ^If X comes from an SQL literal value, or a table column,
** or an expression, then sqlite3_value_frombind(X) returns zero.
**
** Please pay particular attention to the fact that the pointer returned
** from [sqlite3_value_blob()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or
** [sqlite3_value_text16()] can be invalidated by a subsequent call to
** [sqlite3_value_bytes()], [sqlite3_value_bytes16()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_text16()].
**
** These routines must be called from the same thread as
** the SQL function that supplied the [sqlite3_value*] parameters.
**
** As long as the input parameter is correct, these routines can only
** fail if an out-of-memory error occurs during a format conversion.
** Only the following subset of interfaces are subject to out-of-memory
** errors:
**
** <ul>
** <li> sqlite3_value_blob()
** <li> sqlite3_value_text()
** <li> sqlite3_value_text16()
** <li> sqlite3_value_text16le()
** <li> sqlite3_value_text16be()
** <li> sqlite3_value_bytes()
** <li> sqlite3_value_bytes16()
** </ul>
**
** If an out-of-memory error occurs, then the return value from these
** routines is the same as if the column had contained an SQL NULL value.
** Valid SQL NULL returns can be distinguished from out-of-memory errors
** by invoking the [sqlite3_errcode()] immediately after the suspect
** return value is obtained and before any
** other SQLite interface is called on the same [database connection].

** implementation is never called and xFinal() is called exactly once.
** In those cases, sqlite3_aggregate_context() might be called for the

**
** ^The sqlite3_aggregate_context(C,N) routine returns a NULL pointer

** ^(The amount of space allocated by sqlite3_aggregate_context(C,N) is

**
** ^SQLite automatically frees the memory allocated by

** function. The compiled version of the regular expression can be stored as
** metadata associated with the pattern string.
** Then as long as the pattern string remains the same,
** the compiled regular expression can be reused on multiple
** invocations of the same function.
**
** ^The sqlite3_get_auxdata(C,N) interface returns a pointer to the metadata
** associated by the sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) function with the Nth argument
** value to the application-defined function.  ^N is zero for the left-most
** function argument.  ^If there is no metadata
** associated with the function argument, the sqlite3_get_auxdata(C,N) interface
** returns a NULL pointer.
**
** ^The sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) interface saves P as metadata for the N-th

** ^After each call to sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) where X is not NULL,
** SQLite will invoke the destructor function X with parameter P exactly
** once, when the metadata is discarded.
** SQLite is free to discard the metadata at any time, including: <ul>
** <li> ^(when the corresponding function parameter changes)^, or
** <li> ^(when [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] is called for the
**      SQL statement)^, or

** sqlite3_set_auxdata() has been called.
**
** ^(In practice, metadata is preserved between function calls for

**
** These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that
** implement SQL functions and aggregates.  See
** [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the [parameter binding] family of
** functions used to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
** Refer to the [SQL parameter] documentation for additional information.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be the BLOB whose content is pointed
** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_zeroblob(C,N) and sqlite3_result_zeroblob64(C,N)
** interfaces set the result of the application-defined function to be
** a BLOB containing all zero bytes and N bytes in size.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** ^SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  ^SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF-8. ^SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF-16 using
** the same [byte-order determination rules] as [sqlite3_bind_text16()].
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
** sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
** routines make a private copy of the error message text before
** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
** modify the text after they return without harm.
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  ^By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  ^A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_toobig() interface causes SQLite to throw an
** error indicating that a string or BLOB is too long to represent.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_nomem() interface causes SQLite to throw an
** error indicating that a memory allocation failed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
** ^The sqlite3_result_int64() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 64-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_null() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be NULL.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(),
** sqlite3_result_text16le(), and sqlite3_result_text16be() interfaces
** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** ^The sqlite3_result_text64() interface sets the return value of an
** application-defined function to be a text string in an encoding
** specified by the fifth (and last) parameter, which must be one
** of [SQLITE_UTF8], [SQLITE_UTF16], [SQLITE_UTF16BE], or [SQLITE_UTF16LE].
** ^SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter
** through the first zero character.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is non-negative, then as many bytes (not characters) of the text
** pointed to by the 2nd parameter are taken as the application-defined
** function result.  If the 3rd parameter is non-negative, then it
** must be the byte offset into the string where the NUL terminator would
** appear if the string where NUL terminated.  If any NUL characters occur
** in the string at a byte offset that is less than the value of the 3rd
** parameter, then the resulting string will contain embedded NULs and the
** result of expressions operating on strings with embedded NULs is undefined.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that
** function as the destructor on the text or BLOB result when it has
** finished using that result.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces or to
** sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_STATIC, then SQLite
** assumes that the text or BLOB result is in constant space and does not
** copy the content of the parameter nor call a destructor on the content
** when it has finished using that result.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_TRANSIENT
** then SQLite makes a copy of the result into space obtained
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] before it returns.
**
** ^For the sqlite3_result_text16(), sqlite3_result_text16le(), and
** sqlite3_result_text16be() routines, and for sqlite3_result_text64()
** when the encoding is not UTF8, if the input UTF16 begins with a
** byte-order mark (BOM, U+FEFF) then the BOM is removed from the
** string and the rest of the string is interpreted according to the
** byte-order specified by the BOM.  ^The byte-order specified by
** the BOM at the beginning of the text overrides the byte-order
** specified by the interface procedure.  ^So, for example, if
** sqlite3_result_text16le() is invoked with text that begins
** with bytes 0xfe, 0xff (a big-endian byte-order mark) then the
** first two bytes of input are skipped and the remaining input
** is interpreted as UTF16BE text.
**
** ^For UTF16 input text to the sqlite3_result_text16(),
** sqlite3_result_text16be(), sqlite3_result_text16le(), and
** sqlite3_result_text64() routines, if the text contains invalid
** UTF16 characters, the invalid characters might be converted
** into the unicode replacement character, U+FFFD.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_value() interface sets the result of
** the application-defined function to be a copy of the
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object specified by the 2nd parameter.  ^The
** sqlite3_result_value() interface makes a copy of the [sqlite3_value]
** so that the [sqlite3_value] specified in the parameter may change or
** be deallocated after sqlite3_result_value() returns without harm.
** ^A [protected sqlite3_value] object may always be used where an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object is required, so either
** kind of [sqlite3_value] object can be used with this interface.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_pointer(C,P,T,D) interface sets the result to an
** SQL NULL value, just like [sqlite3_result_null(C)], except that it
** also associates the host-language pointer P or type T with that
** NULL value such that the pointer can be retrieved within an
** [application-defined SQL function] using [sqlite3_value_pointer()].
** ^If the D parameter is not NULL, then it is a pointer to a destructor
** for the P parameter.  ^SQLite invokes D with P as its only argument
** when SQLite is finished with P.  The T parameter should be a static
** string and preferably a string literal. The sqlite3_result_pointer()
** routine is part of the [pointer passing interface] added for SQLite 3.20.0.
**
** If these routines are called from within the different thread
** than the one containing the application-defined function that received
** the [sqlite3_context] pointer, the results are undefined.

** ^The eTextRep argument determines the encoding of strings passed

**
** ^The fourth argument, pArg, is an application data pointer that is passed
** through as the first argument to the collating function callback.
**
** ^The fifth argument, xCompare, is a pointer to the collating function.
** ^Multiple collating functions can be registered using the same name but
** with different eTextRep parameters and SQLite will use whichever
** function requires the least amount of data transformation.
** ^If the xCompare argument is NULL then the collating function is
** deleted.  ^When all collating functions having the same name are deleted,
** that collation is no longer usable.
**
** ^The collating function callback is invoked with a copy of the pArg
** application data pointer and with two strings in the encoding specified
** by the eTextRep argument.  The two integer parameters to the collating
** function callback are the length of the two strings, in bytes. The collating
** function must return an integer that is negative, zero, or positive
** if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second,
** respectively.  A collating function must always return the same answer
** given the same inputs.  If two or more collating functions are registered
** to the same collation name (using different eTextRep values) then all
** must give an equivalent answer when invoked with equivalent strings.
** The collating function must obey the following properties for all
** strings A, B, and C:
**
** <ol>
** <li> If A==B then B==A.
** <li> If A==B and B==C then A==C.
** <li> If A&lt;B THEN B&gt;A.
** <li> If A&lt;B and B&lt;C then A&lt;C.

**
** If a collating function fails any of the above constraints and that
** collating function is registered and used, then the behavior of SQLite
** is undefined.
**
** ^The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
** with the addition that the xDestroy callback is invoked on pArg when
** the collating function is deleted.
** ^Collating functions are deleted when they are overridden by later
** calls to the collation creation functions or when the
** [database connection] is closed using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** ^The xDestroy callback is <u>not</u> called if the

**
** The sqlite3_index_info structure and its substructures is used as part
** of the [virtual table] interface to
** pass information into and receive the reply from the [xBestIndex]
** method of a [virtual table module].  The fields under **Inputs** are the
** inputs to xBestIndex and are read-only.  xBestIndex inserts its
** results into the **Outputs** fields.
**
** ^(The aConstraint[] array records WHERE clause constraints of the form:
**
** <blockquote>column OP expr</blockquote>
**
** where OP is =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;=.)^  ^(The particular operator is
** stored in aConstraint[].op using one of the
** [SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_EQ | SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_ values].)^
** ^(The index of the column is stored in
** aConstraint[].iColumn.)^  ^(aConstraint[].usable is TRUE if the
** expr on the right-hand side can be evaluated (and thus the constraint
** is usable) and false if it cannot.)^
**
** ^The optimizer automatically inverts terms of the form "expr OP column"
** and makes other simplifications to the WHERE clause in an attempt to
** get as many WHERE clause terms into the form shown above as possible.
** ^The aConstraint[] array only reports WHERE clause terms that are
** relevant to the particular virtual table being queried.
**
** ^Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
** ^Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.
**
** The colUsed field indicates which columns of the virtual table may be
** required by the current scan. Virtual table columns are numbered from
** zero in the order in which they appear within the CREATE TABLE statement
** passed to sqlite3_declare_vtab(). For the first 63 columns (columns 0-62),
** the corresponding bit is set within the colUsed mask if the column may be
** required by SQLite. If the table has at least 64 columns and any column
** to the right of the first 63 is required, then bit 63 of colUsed is also
** set. In other words, column iCol may be required if the expression
** (colUsed & ((sqlite3_uint64)1 << (iCol>=63 ? 63 : iCol))) evaluates to
** non-zero.
**
** The [xBestIndex] method must fill aConstraintUsage[] with information
** about what parameters to pass to xFilter.  ^If argvIndex>0 then
** the right-hand side of the corresponding aConstraint[] is evaluated
** and becomes the argvIndex-th entry in argv.  ^(If aConstraintUsage[].omit
** is true, then the constraint is assumed to be fully handled by the
** virtual table and might not be checked again by the byte code.)^ ^(The
** aConstraintUsage[].omit flag is an optimization hint. When the omit flag
** is left in its default setting of false, the constraint will always be
** checked separately in byte code.  If the omit flag is change to true, then
** the constraint may or may not be checked in byte code.  In other words,
** when the omit flag is true there is no guarantee that the constraint will
** not be checked again using byte code.)^
**
** ^The idxNum and idxPtr values are recorded and passed into the
** [xFilter] method.
** ^[sqlite3_free()] is used to free idxPtr if and only if
** needToFreeIdxPtr is true.
**
** ^The orderByConsumed means that output from [xFilter]/[xNext] will occur in
** the correct order to satisfy the ORDER BY clause so that no separate
** sorting step is required.
**
** ^The estimatedCost value is an estimate of the cost of a particular
** strategy. A cost of N indicates that the cost of the strategy is similar
** to a linear scan of an SQLite table with N rows. A cost of log(N)
** indicates that the expense of the operation is similar to that of a
** binary search on a unique indexed field of an SQLite table with N rows.
**
** ^The estimatedRows value is an estimate of the number of rows that
** will be returned by the strategy.
**
** The xBestIndex method may optionally populate the idxFlags field with a
** mask of SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_* flags. Currently there is only one such flag -
** SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE. If the xBestIndex method sets this flag, SQLite
** assumes that the strategy may visit at most one row.
**
** Additionally, if xBestIndex sets the SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE flag, then
** SQLite also assumes that if a call to the xUpdate() method is made as
** part of the same statement to delete or update a virtual table row and the
** implementation returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, then there is no need to rollback
** any database changes. In other words, if the xUpdate() returns
** SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the database contents must be exactly as they were
** before xUpdate was called. By contrast, if SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE is not
** set and xUpdate returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, any database changes made by
** the xUpdate method are automatically rolled back by SQLite.
**
** IMPORTANT: The estimatedRows field was added to the sqlite3_index_info
** structure for SQLite [version 3.8.2] ([dateof:3.8.2]).
** If a virtual table extension is
** used with an SQLite version earlier than 3.8.2, the results of attempting
** to read or write the estimatedRows field are undefined (but are likely
** to include crashing the application). The estimatedRows field should
** therefore only be used if [sqlite3_libversion_number()] returns a
** value greater than or equal to 3008002. Similarly, the idxFlags field
** was added for [version 3.9.0] ([dateof:3.9.0]).
** It may therefore only be used if
** sqlite3_libversion_number() returns a value greater than or equal to
** 3009000.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Mutexes
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization. Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations
** of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
** is selected automatically at compile-time.  The following
** implementations are available in the SQLite core:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in
** a single-threaded application.  The SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS and
** SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations are appropriate for use on Unix
** and Windows.
**
** If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library. In this case the
** application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite3_config() function
** before calling sqlite3_initialize() or any other public sqlite3_
** function that calls sqlite3_initialize().
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. ^The sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** routine returns NULL if it is unable to allocate the requested
** mutex.  The argument to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() must one of these
** integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MAIN
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_OPEN
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PMEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_APP1
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_APP2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_APP3
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_VFS1
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_VFS2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_VFS3
** </ul>
**
** ^The first two constants (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE)
** cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  ^The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** ^The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() (anything other
** than SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  ^Nine static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** ^Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  ^For the static
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex.  Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex.  ^If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY.  ^The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
** upon successful entry.  ^(Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** In such cases, the
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.)^  If the same thread tries to enter any mutex other
** than an SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE more than once, the behavior is undefined.
**
** ^(Some systems (for example, Windows 95) do not support the operation
** implemented by sqlite3_mutex_try().  On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try()
** will always return SQLITE_BUSY. The SQLite core only ever uses
** sqlite3_mutex_try() as an optimization so this is acceptable
** behavior.)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was
** previously entered by the same thread.   The behavior
** is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered by the
** calling thread or is not currently allocated.
**
** ^If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_enter(), sqlite3_mutex_try(), or

** CAPI3REF: Mutex Methods Object
**
** An instance of this structure defines the low-level routines
** used to allocate and use mutexes.
**
** Usually, the default mutex implementations provided by SQLite are
** sufficient, however the application has the option of substituting a custom
** implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite
** does not provide a suitable implementation. In this case, the application
** creates and populates an instance of this structure to pass
** to sqlite3_config() along with the [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option.
** Additionally, an instance of this structure can be used as an
** output variable when querying the system for the current mutex
** implementation, using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMUTEX] option.
**
** ^The xMutexInit method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system initialization by the sqlite3_initialize() function.
** ^The xMutexInit routine is called by SQLite exactly once for each
** effective call to [sqlite3_initialize()].
**
** ^The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system shutdown by the sqlite3_shutdown() function. The
** implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
** resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
** those obtained by the xMutexInit method.  ^The xMutexEnd()
** interface is invoked exactly once for each call to [sqlite3_shutdown()].
**
** ^(The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,
** xMutexFree, xMutexEnter, xMutexTry, xMutexLeave, xMutexHeld and
** xMutexNotheld) implement the following interfaces (respectively):
**
** <ul>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_alloc()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_free()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_enter()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_try()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_leave()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_held()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_notheld()] </li>
** </ul>)^
**
** The only difference is that the public sqlite3_XXX functions enumerated
** above silently ignore any invocations that pass a NULL pointer instead
** of a valid mutex handle. The implementations of the methods defined
** by this structure are not required to handle this case. The results
** of passing a NULL pointer instead of a valid mutex handle are undefined
** (i.e. it is acceptable to provide an implementation that segfaults if
** it is passed a NULL pointer).
**
** The xMutexInit() method must be threadsafe.  It must be harmless to
** invoke xMutexInit() multiple times within the same process and without
** intervening calls to xMutexEnd().  Second and subsequent calls to
** xMutexInit() must be no-ops.
**
** xMutexInit() must not use SQLite memory allocation ([sqlite3_malloc()]
** and its associates).  Similarly, xMutexAlloc() must not use SQLite memory
** allocation for a static mutex.  ^However xMutexAlloc() may use SQLite
** memory allocation for a fast or recursive mutex.
**
** ^SQLite will invoke the xMutexEnd() method when [sqlite3_shutdown()] is
** called, but only if the prior call to xMutexInit returned SQLITE_OK.
** If xMutexInit fails in any way, it is expected to clean up after itself
** prior to returning.

**
** The implementation is not required to provide versions of these

** return true so that one does not get spurious assertion failures.
**
** If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_held() is a NULL pointer then

** clearly the mutex cannot be held if it does not exist.  But
** the reason the mutex does not exist is because the build is not

** These routines provide access to the set of SQL language keywords
** recognized by SQLite.  Applications can uses these routines to determine
** whether or not a specific identifier needs to be escaped (for example,
** by enclosing in double-quotes) so as not to confuse the parser.
**
** The sqlite3_keyword_count() interface returns the number of distinct
** keywords understood by SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_keyword_name(N,Z,L) interface finds the N-th keyword and
** makes *Z point to that keyword expressed as UTF8 and writes the number
** of bytes in the keyword into *L.  The string that *Z points to is not
** zero-terminated.  The sqlite3_keyword_name(N,Z,L) routine returns
** SQLITE_OK if N is within bounds and SQLITE_ERROR if not. If either Z
** or L are NULL or invalid pointers then calls to
** sqlite3_keyword_name(N,Z,L) result in undefined behavior.
**
** The sqlite3_keyword_check(Z,L) interface checks to see whether or not
** the L-byte UTF8 identifier that Z points to is a keyword, returning non-zero
** if it is and zero if not.
**
** The parser used by SQLite is forgiving.  It is often possible to use
** a keyword as an identifier as long as such use does not result in a
** parsing ambiguity.  For example, the statement
** "CREATE TABLE BEGIN(REPLACE,PRAGMA,END);" is accepted by SQLite, and
** creates a new table named "BEGIN" with three columns named
** "REPLACE", "PRAGMA", and "END".  Nevertheless, best practice is to avoid
** using keywords as identifiers.  Common techniques used to avoid keyword
** name collisions include:
** <ul>
** <li> Put all identifier names inside double-quotes.  This is the official
**      SQL way to escape identifier names.
** <li> Put identifier names inside &#91;...&#93;.  This is not standard SQL,
**      but it is what SQL Server does and so lots of programmers use this
**      technique.
** <li> Begin every identifier with the letter "Z" as no SQL keywords start
**      with "Z".
** <li> Include a digit somewhere in every identifier name.
** </ul>
**
** Note that the number of keywords understood by SQLite can depend on
** compile-time options.  For example, "VACUUM" is not a keyword if
** SQLite is compiled with the [-DSQLITE_OMIT_VACUUM] option.  Also,
** new keywords may be added to future releases of SQLite.

**
** ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
** register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an
** instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
** In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by
** SQLite is used for the page cache.
** By implementing a
** custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
** the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which
** that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to
** determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for
** how long.
**
** The alternative page cache mechanism is an
** extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
** The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
**
** ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an
** internal buffer by SQLite within the call to [sqlite3_config].  Hence
** the application may discard the parameter after the call to
** [sqlite3_config()] returns.)^
**
** [[the xInit() page cache method]]
** ^(The xInit() method is called once for each effective
** call to [sqlite3_initialize()])^
** (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). ^(The xInit()
** method is passed a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2.pArg value.)^
** The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures
** required by the custom page cache implementation.
** ^(If the xInit() method is NULL, then the
** built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
** page cache.)^
**
** [[the xShutdown() page cache method]]
** ^The xShutdown() method is called by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
** It can be used to clean up
** any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
** ^The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
**
** ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,
** so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  All other methods must be threadsafe
** in multithreaded applications.
**
** ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().
**
** [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
** SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
** though this is not guaranteed. ^The
** first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
** be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The
** second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage
** associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
** a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
** extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
** database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
** on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
** ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
** created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
** false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
** does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
** it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
** never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
** ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
** false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.
** ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
** never contain any unpinned pages.
**
** [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
** ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
** suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
** instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
** the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
** parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
** value; it is advisory only.
**
** [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
** The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
** stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
**
** [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
** The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to
** an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
** The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
** pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a
** single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
** a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
** for each entry in the page cache.
**
** The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
** is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
** to be "pinned".
**
** If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
** implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
** intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
** cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
** parameter to help it determined what action to take:
**
** <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
** <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
** <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
** <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
**                 Otherwise return NULL.
** <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
**                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
** </table>
**
** ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
** will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
** failed.)^  In between the xFetch() calls, SQLite may
** attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
** pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
**
** [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
** ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
** as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
** then the page must be evicted from the cache.
** ^If the discard parameter is
** zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
** page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
** may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
**
** The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single
** call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls
** to xFetch().
**
** [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
** The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
** page passed as the second argument. If the cache
** previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
** discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
** to be pinned.
**
** When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
** existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
** to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
** of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
** they can be safely discarded.
**
** [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
** ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
** All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After
** calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
** handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods2
** functions.
**
** [[the xShrink() page cache method]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xShrink() method when it wants the page cache to
** free up as much of heap memory as possible.  The page cache implementation
** is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should
** do their best.

** <b>Concurrent Usage of Database Handles</b>
**
** ^The source [database connection] may be used by the application for other

** ^If SQLite is compiled and configured to support threadsafe database
** connections, then the source database connection may be used concurrently
** from within other threads.
**
** However, the application must guarantee that the destination
** [database connection] is not passed to any other API (by any thread) after
** sqlite3_backup_init() is called and before the corresponding call to
** sqlite3_backup_finish().  SQLite does not currently check to see
** if the application incorrectly accesses the destination [database connection]
** and so no error code is reported, but the operations may malfunction
** nevertheless.  Use of the destination database connection while a
** backup is in progress might also also cause a mutex deadlock.
**
** If running in [shared cache mode], the application must
** guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
** is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
** that the application must guarantee that the disk file being
** backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
** not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** The [sqlite3_backup] object itself is partially threadsafe. Multiple
** threads may safely make multiple concurrent calls to sqlite3_backup_step().
** However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()
** APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe. If they are invoked at the
** same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is
** possible that they return invalid values.

** CAPI3REF: Unlock Notification
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
** an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
** individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
** [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking.
** ^This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke
** when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
** ^This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** ^Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back.
**
** ^When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. ^After an
** application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. ^The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite3_step] or [sqlite3_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connection's transaction.
**
** ^(If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite3_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite3_unlock_notify().)^
**
** ^If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** ^(There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a
** blocked connection. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old.)^ ^If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is canceled. ^The blocked connections
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite3_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** ^Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite3_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connection's transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. ^If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. ^If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. ^Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. ^Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite3_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost
** always appropriate to call sqlite3_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite3_step() call. ^(If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just
** SQLITE_LOCKED.)^

/*
** CAPI3REF: Serialize a database
**
** The sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F) interface returns a pointer to memory
** that is a serialization of the S database on [database connection] D.
** If P is not a NULL pointer, then the size of the database in bytes
** is written into *P.
**
** For an ordinary on-disk database file, the serialization is just a
** copy of the disk file.  For an in-memory database or a "TEMP" database,
** the serialization is the same sequence of bytes which would be written
** to disk if that database where backed up to disk.
**
** The usual case is that sqlite3_serialize() copies the serialization of
** the database into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc64()] and returns
** a pointer to that memory.  The caller is responsible for freeing the
** returned value to avoid a memory leak.  However, if the F argument
** contains the SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY bit, then no memory allocations
** are made, and the sqlite3_serialize() function will return a pointer
** to the contiguous memory representation of the database that SQLite
** is currently using for that database, or NULL if the no such contiguous
** memory representation of the database exists.  A contiguous memory
** representation of the database will usually only exist if there has
** been a prior call to [sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,...)] with the same
** values of D and S.
** The size of the database is written into *P even if the
** SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY bit is set but no contiguous copy
** of the database exists.
**
** A call to sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F) might return NULL even if the
** SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY bit is omitted from argument F if a memory
** allocation error occurs.
**
** This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_DESERIALIZE] option.

** CAPI3REF: Generate A Changeset From A Session Object
** METHOD: sqlite3_session
**
** Obtain a changeset containing changes to the tables attached to the
** session object passed as the first argument. If successful,
** set *ppChangeset to point to a buffer containing the changeset
** and *pnChangeset to the size of the changeset in bytes before returning
** SQLITE_OK. If an error occurs, set both *ppChangeset and *pnChangeset to
** zero and return an SQLite error code.
**
** A changeset consists of zero or more INSERT, UPDATE and/or DELETE changes,
** each representing a change to a single row of an attached table. An INSERT
** change contains the values of each field of a new database row. A DELETE
** contains the original values of each field of a deleted database row. An
** UPDATE change contains the original values of each field of an updated
** database row along with the updated values for each updated non-primary-key
** column. It is not possible for an UPDATE change to represent a change that
** modifies the values of primary key columns. If such a change is made, it
** is represented in a changeset as a DELETE followed by an INSERT.
**
** Changes are not recorded for rows that have NULL values stored in one or
** more of their PRIMARY KEY columns. If such a row is inserted or deleted,
** no corresponding change is present in the changesets returned by this
** function. If an existing row with one or more NULL values stored in
** PRIMARY KEY columns is updated so that all PRIMARY KEY columns are non-NULL,
** only an INSERT is appears in the changeset. Similarly, if an existing row
** with non-NULL PRIMARY KEY values is updated so that one or more of its
** PRIMARY KEY columns are set to NULL, the resulting changeset contains a
** DELETE change only.
**
** The contents of a changeset may be traversed using an iterator created
** using the [sqlite3changeset_start()] API. A changeset may be applied to
** a database with a compatible schema using the [sqlite3changeset_apply()]
** API.
**
** Within a changeset generated by this function, all changes related to a
** single table are grouped together. In other words, when iterating through
** a changeset or when applying a changeset to a database, all changes related
** to a single table are processed before moving on to the next table. Tables
** are sorted in the same order in which they were attached (or auto-attached)
** to the sqlite3_session object. The order in which the changes related to
** a single table are stored is undefined.
**
** Following a successful call to this function, it is the responsibility of
** the caller to eventually free the buffer that *ppChangeset points to using
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** <h3>Changeset Generation</h3>
**
** Once a table has been attached to a session object, the session object
** records the primary key values of all new rows inserted into the table.
** It also records the original primary key and other column values of any
** deleted or updated rows. For each unique primary key value, data is only
** recorded once - the first time a row with said primary key is inserted,
** updated or deleted in the lifetime of the session.
**
** There is one exception to the previous paragraph: when a row is inserted,
** updated or deleted, if one or more of its primary key columns contain a
** NULL value, no record of the change is made.
**
** The session object therefore accumulates two types of records - those
** that consist of primary key values only (created when the user inserts
** a new record) and those that consist of the primary key values and the
** original values of other table columns (created when the users deletes
** or updates a record).
**
** When this function is called, the requested changeset is created using
** both the accumulated records and the current contents of the database
** file. Specifically:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> For each record generated by an insert, the database is queried
**        for a row with a matching primary key. If one is found, an INSERT
**        change is added to the changeset. If no such row is found, no change
**        is added to the changeset.
**
**   <li> For each record generated by an update or delete, the database is
**        queried for a row with a matching primary key. If such a row is
**        found and one or more of the non-primary key fields have been
**        modified from their original values, an UPDATE change is added to
**        the changeset. Or, if no such row is found in the table, a DELETE
**        change is added to the changeset. If there is a row with a matching
**        primary key in the database, but all fields contain their original
**        values, no change is added to the changeset.
** </ul>
**
** This means, amongst other things, that if a row is inserted and then later
** deleted while a session object is active, neither the insert nor the delete
** will be present in the changeset. Or if a row is deleted and then later a
** row with the same primary key values inserted while a session object is
** active, the resulting changeset will contain an UPDATE change instead of
** a DELETE and an INSERT.
**
** When a session object is disabled (see the [sqlite3session_enable()] API),
** it does not accumulate records when rows are inserted, updated or deleted.
** This may appear to have some counter-intuitive effects if a single row
** is written to more than once during a session. For example, if a row
** is inserted while a session object is enabled, then later deleted while
** the same session object is disabled, no INSERT record will appear in the
** changeset, even though the delete took place while the session was disabled.
** Or, if one field of a row is updated while a session is disabled, and
** another field of the same row is updated while the session is enabled, the
** resulting changeset will contain an UPDATE change that updates both fields.

** METHOD: sqlite3_session
**
** If it is not already attached to the session object passed as the first

** [sqlite3session_attach()] function. If zTbl does not exist, or if it
** does not have a primary key, this function is a no-op (but does not return
** an error).
**
** Argument zFromDb must be the name of a database ("main", "temp" etc.)
** attached to the same database handle as the session object that contains
** a table compatible with the table attached to the session by this function.
** A table is considered compatible if it:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> Has the same name,
**   <li> Has the same set of columns declared in the same order, and
**   <li> Has the same PRIMARY KEY definition.
** </ul>
**
** If the tables are not compatible, SQLITE_SCHEMA is returned. If the tables
** are compatible but do not have any PRIMARY KEY columns, it is not an error
** but no changes are added to the session object. As with other session
** APIs, tables without PRIMARY KEYs are simply ignored.
**
** This function adds a set of changes to the session object that could be
** used to update the table in database zFrom (call this the "from-table")
** so that its content is the same as the table attached to the session
** object (call this the "to-table"). Specifically:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in the to-table but not in
**     the from-table, an INSERT record is added to the session object.
**
**   <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in the to-table but not in
**     the from-table, a DELETE record is added to the session object.
**
**   <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in both tables, but features
**     different non-PK values in each, an UPDATE record is added to the
**     session.
** </ul>
**
** To clarify, if this function is called and then a changeset constructed
** using [sqlite3session_changeset()], then after applying that changeset to
** database zFrom the contents of the two compatible tables would be
** identical.
**
** It an error if database zFrom does not exist or does not contain the
** required compatible table.
**
** If the operation is successful, SQLITE_OK is returned. Otherwise, an SQLite
** error code. In this case, if argument pzErrMsg is not NULL, *pzErrMsg
** may be set to point to a buffer containing an English language error
** message. It is the responsibility of the caller to free this buffer using

/*
** CAPI3REF: Create A New Changegroup Object
** CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3_changegroup
**
** An sqlite3_changegroup object is used to combine two or more changesets
** (or patchsets) into a single changeset (or patchset). A single changegroup
** object may combine changesets or patchsets, but not both. The output is
** always in the same format as the input.
**
** If successful, this function returns SQLITE_OK and populates (*pp) with
** a pointer to a new sqlite3_changegroup object before returning. The caller
** should eventually free the returned object using a call to
** sqlite3changegroup_delete(). If an error occurs, an SQLite error code
** (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM) is returned and *pp is set to NULL.
**
** The usual usage pattern for an sqlite3_changegroup object is as follows:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> It is created using a call to sqlite3changegroup_new().
**
**   <li> Zero or more changesets (or patchsets) are added to the object
**        by calling sqlite3changegroup_add().
**
**   <li> The result of combining all input changesets together is obtained
**        by the application via a call to sqlite3changegroup_output().
**
**   <li> The object is deleted using a call to sqlite3changegroup_delete().
** </ul>
**
** Any number of calls to add() and output() may be made between the calls to
** new() and delete(), and in any order.
**
** As well as the regular sqlite3changegroup_add() and
** sqlite3changegroup_output() functions, also available are the streaming
** versions sqlite3changegroup_add_strm() and sqlite3changegroup_output_strm().

SQLITE_API int sqlite3changegroup_new(sqlite3_changegroup **pp);

/*
** CAPI3REF: Add A Changeset To A Changegroup
** METHOD: sqlite3_changegroup
**
** Add all changes within the changeset (or patchset) in buffer pData (size
** nData bytes) to the changegroup.
**
** If the buffer contains a patchset, then all prior calls to this function
** on the same changegroup object must also have specified patchsets. Or, if
** the buffer contains a changeset, so must have the earlier calls to this
** function. Otherwise, SQLITE_ERROR is returned and no changes are added
** to the changegroup.
**
** Rows within the changeset and changegroup are identified by the values in
** their PRIMARY KEY columns. A change in the changeset is considered to
** apply to the same row as a change already present in the changegroup if
** the two rows have the same primary key.
**
** Changes to rows that do not already appear in the changegroup are
** simply copied into it. Or, if both the new changeset and the changegroup
** contain changes that apply to a single row, the final contents of the
** changegroup depends on the type of each change, as follows:
**
** <table border=1 style="margin-left:8ex;margin-right:8ex">

**       <th style="white-space:pre">New Change       </th>
**       <th>Output Change
**   <tr><td>INSERT <td>INSERT <td>
**       The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new
**       changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already
**       added to the changegroup.
**   <tr><td>INSERT <td>UPDATE <td>
**       The INSERT change remains in the changegroup. The values in the
**       INSERT change are modified as if the row was inserted by the
**       existing change and then updated according to the new change.
**   <tr><td>INSERT <td>DELETE <td>
**       The existing INSERT is removed from the changegroup. The DELETE is
**       not added.
**   <tr><td>UPDATE <td>INSERT <td>
**       The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new
**       changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already
**       added to the changegroup.
**   <tr><td>UPDATE <td>UPDATE <td>
**       The existing UPDATE remains within the changegroup. It is amended
**       so that the accompanying values are as if the row was updated once
**       by the existing change and then again by the new change.
**   <tr><td>UPDATE <td>DELETE <td>
**       The existing UPDATE is replaced by the new DELETE within the
**       changegroup.
**   <tr><td>DELETE <td>INSERT <td>
**       If one or more of the column values in the row inserted by the
**       new change differ from those in the row deleted by the existing
**       change, the existing DELETE is replaced by an UPDATE within the
**       changegroup. Otherwise, if the inserted row is exactly the same
**       as the deleted row, the existing DELETE is simply discarded.
**   <tr><td>DELETE <td>UPDATE <td>
**       The new change is ignored. This case does not occur if the new
**       changeset was recorded immediately after the changesets already
**       added to the changegroup.

**
** If the new changeset contains changes to a table that is already present
** in the changegroup, then the number of columns and the position of the
** primary key columns for the table must be consistent. If this is not the
** case, this function fails with SQLITE_SCHEMA. If the input changeset
** appears to be corrupt and the corruption is detected, SQLITE_CORRUPT is
** returned. Or, if an out-of-memory condition occurs during processing, this
** function returns SQLITE_NOMEM. In all cases, if an error occurs the state
** of the final contents of the changegroup is undefined.
**
** If no error occurs, SQLITE_OK is returned.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Apply A Changeset To A Database
**
** Apply a changeset or patchset to a database. These functions attempt to
** update the "main" database attached to handle db with the changes found in
** the changeset passed via the second and third arguments.
**
** The fourth argument (xFilter) passed to these functions is the "filter
** callback". If it is not NULL, then for each table affected by at least one
** change in the changeset, the filter callback is invoked with
** the table name as the second argument, and a copy of the context pointer
** passed as the sixth argument as the first. If the "filter callback"
** returns zero, then no attempt is made to apply any changes to the table.
** Otherwise, if the return value is non-zero or the xFilter argument to
** is NULL, all changes related to the table are attempted.
**
** For each table that is not excluded by the filter callback, this function
** tests that the target database contains a compatible table. A table is
** considered compatible if all of the following are true:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> The table has the same name as the name recorded in the
**        changeset, and
**   <li> The table has at least as many columns as recorded in the
**        changeset, and
**   <li> The table has primary key columns in the same position as
**        recorded in the changeset.
** </ul>
**
** If there is no compatible table, it is not an error, but none of the
** changes associated with the table are applied. A warning message is issued
** via the sqlite3_log() mechanism with the error code SQLITE_SCHEMA. At most
** one such warning is issued for each table in the changeset.
**
** For each change for which there is a compatible table, an attempt is made
** to modify the table contents according to the UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE
** change. If a change cannot be applied cleanly, the conflict handler
** function passed as the fifth argument to sqlite3changeset_apply() may be
** invoked. A description of exactly when the conflict handler is invoked for
** each type of change is below.
**
** Unlike the xFilter argument, xConflict may not be passed NULL. The results
** of passing anything other than a valid function pointer as the xConflict
** argument are undefined.
**
** Each time the conflict handler function is invoked, it must return one
** of [SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT], [SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT] or
** [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE]. SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE may only be returned
** if the second argument passed to the conflict handler is either
** SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA or SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT. If the conflict-handler
** returns an illegal value, any changes already made are rolled back and
** the call to sqlite3changeset_apply() returns SQLITE_MISUSE. Different
** actions are taken by sqlite3changeset_apply() depending on the value
** returned by each invocation of the conflict-handler function. Refer to
** the documentation for the three
** [SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT|available return values] for details.
**
** <dl>
** <dt>DELETE Changes<dd>
**   For each DELETE change, the function checks if the target database
**   contains a row with the same primary key value (or values) as the
**   original row values stored in the changeset. If it does, and the values
**   stored in all non-primary key columns also match the values stored in
**   the changeset the row is deleted from the target database.
**
**   If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more of
**   the non-primary key fields contains a value different from the original
**   row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function is
**   invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA] as the second argument. If the
**   database table has more columns than are recorded in the changeset,
**   only the values of those non-primary key fields are compared against
**   the current database contents - any trailing database table columns
**   are ignored.
**
**   If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
**   the conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND]
**   passed as the second argument.
**
**   If the DELETE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT
**   (which can only happen if a foreign key constraint is violated), the
**   conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT]
**   passed as the second argument. This includes the case where the DELETE
**   operation is attempted because an earlier call to the conflict handler
**   function returned [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
**
** <dt>INSERT Changes<dd>
**   For each INSERT change, an attempt is made to insert the new row into
**   the database. If the changeset row contains fewer fields than the
**   database table, the trailing fields are populated with their default
**   values.
**
**   If the attempt to insert the row fails because the database already
**   contains a row with the same primary key values, the conflict handler
**   function is invoked with the second argument set to
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT].
**
**   If the attempt to insert the row fails because of some other constraint
**   violation (e.g. NOT NULL or UNIQUE), the conflict handler function is
**   invoked with the second argument set to [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT].
**   This includes the case where the INSERT operation is re-attempted because
**   an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
**
** <dt>UPDATE Changes<dd>
**   For each UPDATE change, the function checks if the target database
**   contains a row with the same primary key value (or values) as the
**   original row values stored in the changeset. If it does, and the values
**   stored in all modified non-primary key columns also match the values
**   stored in the changeset the row is updated within the target database.
**
**   If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more of
**   the modified non-primary key fields contains a value different from an
**   original row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function
**   is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA] as the second argument. Since
**   UPDATE changes only contain values for non-primary key fields that are
**   to be modified, only those fields need to match the original values to
**   avoid the SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA conflict-handler callback.
**
**   If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
**   the conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND]
**   passed as the second argument.
**
**   If the UPDATE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns
**   SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the conflict-handler function is invoked with
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT] passed as the second argument.
**   This includes the case where the UPDATE operation is attempted after
**   an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
** </dl>
**
** It is safe to execute SQL statements, including those that write to the
** table that the callback related to, from within the xConflict callback.
** This can be used to further customize the application's conflict
** resolution strategy.
**
** All changes made by these functions are enclosed in a savepoint transaction.
** If any other error (aside from a constraint failure when attempting to
** write to the target database) occurs, then the savepoint transaction is
** rolled back, restoring the target database to its original state, and an
** SQLite error code returned.
**
** If the output parameters (ppRebase) and (pnRebase) are non-NULL and
** the input is a changeset (not a patchset), then sqlite3changeset_apply_v2()
** may set (*ppRebase) to point to a "rebase" that may be used with the
** sqlite3_rebaser APIs buffer before returning. In this case (*pnRebase)
** is set to the size of the buffer in bytes. It is the responsibility of the
** caller to eventually free any such buffer using sqlite3_free(). The buffer
** is only allocated and populated if one or more conflicts were encountered
** while applying the patchset. See comments surrounding the sqlite3_rebaser
** APIs for further details.
**
** The behavior of sqlite3changeset_apply_v2() and its streaming equivalent
** may be modified by passing a combination of
** [SQLITE_CHANGESETAPPLY_NOSAVEPOINT | supported flags] as the 9th parameter.
**
** Note that the sqlite3changeset_apply_v2() API is still <b>experimental</b>
** and therefore subject to change.

** CAPI3REF: Configure global parameters
**
** The sqlite3session_config() interface is used to make global configuration
** changes to the sessions module in order to tune it to the specific needs
** of the application.
**
** The sqlite3session_config() interface is not threadsafe. If it is invoked
** while any other thread is inside any other sessions method then the
** results are undefined. Furthermore, if it is invoked after any sessions
** related objects have been created, the results are also undefined.
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3session_config() function must be one
** of the SQLITE_SESSION_CONFIG_XXX constants defined below. The
** interpretation of the (void*) value passed as the second parameter and
** the effect of calling this function depends on the value of the first
** parameter.
**
** <dl>
** <dt>SQLITE_SESSION_CONFIG_STRMSIZE<dd>
**    By default, the sessions module streaming interfaces attempt to input
**    and output data in approximately 1 KiB chunks. This operand may be used
**    to set and query the value of this configuration setting. The pointer
**    passed as the second argument must point to a value of type (int).
**    If this value is greater than 0, it is used as the new streaming data
**    chunk size for both input and output. Before returning, the (int) value
**    pointed to by pArg is set to the final value of the streaming interface
**    chunk size.
** </dl>
**
** This function returns SQLITE_OK if successful, or an SQLite error code
** otherwise.

** EXTENSION API FUNCTIONS
**
** xUserData(pFts):
**   Return a copy of the context pointer the extension function was
**   registered with.
**
** xColumnTotalSize(pFts, iCol, pnToken):
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, set output variable *pnToken
**   to the total number of tokens in the FTS5 table. Or, if iCol is
**   non-negative but less than the number of columns in the table, return
**   the total number of tokens in column iCol, considering all rows in
**   the FTS5 table.
**
**   If parameter iCol is greater than or equal to the number of columns
**   in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned. Or, if an error occurs (e.g.
**   an OOM condition or IO error), an appropriate SQLite error code is
**   returned.
**
** xColumnCount(pFts):
**   Return the number of columns in the table.
**
** xColumnSize(pFts, iCol, pnToken):
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, set output variable *pnToken
**   to the total number of tokens in the current row. Or, if iCol is
**   non-negative but less than the number of columns in the table, set
**   *pnToken to the number of tokens in column iCol of the current row.
**
**   If parameter iCol is greater than or equal to the number of columns
**   in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned. Or, if an error occurs (e.g.
**   an OOM condition or IO error), an appropriate SQLite error code is
**   returned.
**
**   This function may be quite inefficient if used with an FTS5 table
**   created with the "columnsize=0" option.
**
** xColumnText:
**   This function attempts to retrieve the text of column iCol of the
**   current document. If successful, (*pz) is set to point to a buffer
**   containing the text in utf-8 encoding, (*pn) is set to the size in bytes
**   (not characters) of the buffer and SQLITE_OK is returned. Otherwise,
**   if an error occurs, an SQLite error code is returned and the final values
**   of (*pz) and (*pn) are undefined.
**
** xPhraseCount:
**   Returns the number of phrases in the current query expression.
**
** xPhraseSize:
**   Returns the number of tokens in phrase iPhrase of the query. Phrases
**   are numbered starting from zero.
**
** xInstCount:
**   Set *pnInst to the total number of occurrences of all phrases within
**   the query within the current row. Return SQLITE_OK if successful, or
**   an error code (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM) if an error occurs.
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option. If the FTS5 table is created
**   with either "detail=none" or "detail=column" and "content=" option
**   (i.e. if it is a contentless table), then this API always returns 0.
**
** xInst:
**   Query for the details of phrase match iIdx within the current row.
**   Phrase matches are numbered starting from zero, so the iIdx argument
**   should be greater than or equal to zero and smaller than the value
**   output by xInstCount().
**
**   Usually, output parameter *piPhrase is set to the phrase number, *piCol
**   to the column in which it occurs and *piOff the token offset of the
**   first token of the phrase. Returns SQLITE_OK if successful, or an error
**   code (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM) if an error occurs.
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option.
**
** xRowid:
**   Returns the rowid of the current row.
**
** xTokenize:
**   Tokenize text using the tokenizer belonging to the FTS5 table.
**
** xQueryPhrase(pFts5, iPhrase, pUserData, xCallback):
**   This API function is used to query the FTS table for phrase iPhrase
**   of the current query. Specifically, a query equivalent to:
**
**       ... FROM ftstable WHERE ftstable MATCH $p ORDER BY rowid
**
**   with $p set to a phrase equivalent to the phrase iPhrase of the
**   current query is executed. Any column filter that applies to
**   phrase iPhrase of the current query is included in $p. For each
**   row visited, the callback function passed as the fourth argument
**   is invoked. The context and API objects passed to the callback
**   function may be used to access the properties of each matched row.
**   Invoking Api.xUserData() returns a copy of the pointer passed as
**   the third argument to pUserData.
**
**   If the callback function returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, the
**   query is abandoned and the xQueryPhrase function returns immediately.
**   If the returned value is SQLITE_DONE, xQueryPhrase returns SQLITE_OK.
**   Otherwise, the error code is propagated upwards.
**
**   If the query runs to completion without incident, SQLITE_OK is returned.
**   Or, if some error occurs before the query completes or is aborted by
**   the callback, an SQLite error code is returned.
**
**
** xSetAuxdata(pFts5, pAux, xDelete)
**
**   Save the pointer passed as the second argument as the extension function's
**   "auxiliary data". The pointer may then be retrieved by the current or any
**   future invocation of the same fts5 extension function made as part of
**   the same MATCH query using the xGetAuxdata() API.
**
**   Each extension function is allocated a single auxiliary data slot for
**   each FTS query (MATCH expression). If the extension function is invoked
**   more than once for a single FTS query, then all invocations share a
**   single auxiliary data context.
**
**   If there is already an auxiliary data pointer when this function is
**   invoked, then it is replaced by the new pointer. If an xDelete callback
**   was specified along with the original pointer, it is invoked at this
**   point.
**
**   The xDelete callback, if one is specified, is also invoked on the
**   auxiliary data pointer after the FTS5 query has finished.
**
**   If an error (e.g. an OOM condition) occurs within this function,
**   the auxiliary data is set to NULL and an error code returned. If the
**   xDelete parameter was not NULL, it is invoked on the auxiliary data
**   pointer before returning.
**
**
** xGetAuxdata(pFts5, bClear)
**
**   Returns the current auxiliary data pointer for the fts5 extension
**   function. See the xSetAuxdata() method for details.
**
**   If the bClear argument is non-zero, then the auxiliary data is cleared
**   (set to NULL) before this function returns. In this case the xDelete,
**   if any, is not invoked.
**
**
** xRowCount(pFts5, pnRow)
**
**   This function is used to retrieve the total number of rows in the table.
**   In other words, the same value that would be returned by:
**
**        SELECT count(*) FROM ftstable;
**
** xPhraseFirst()
**   This function is used, along with type Fts5PhraseIter and the xPhraseNext
**   method, to iterate through all instances of a single query phrase within
**   the current row. This is the same information as is accessible via the
**   xInstCount/xInst APIs. While the xInstCount/xInst APIs are more convenient
**   to use, this API may be faster under some circumstances. To iterate
**   through instances of phrase iPhrase, use the following code:
**
**       Fts5PhraseIter iter;
**       int iCol, iOff;
**       for(pApi->xPhraseFirst(pFts, iPhrase, &iter, &iCol, &iOff);
**           iCol>=0;
**           pApi->xPhraseNext(pFts, &iter, &iCol, &iOff)
**       ){
**         // An instance of phrase iPhrase at offset iOff of column iCol
**       }
**
**   The Fts5PhraseIter structure is defined above. Applications should not
**   modify this structure directly - it should only be used as shown above
**   with the xPhraseFirst() and xPhraseNext() API methods (and by
**   xPhraseFirstColumn() and xPhraseNextColumn() as illustrated below).
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option. If the FTS5 table is created
**   with either "detail=none" or "detail=column" and "content=" option
**   (i.e. if it is a contentless table), then this API always iterates
**   through an empty set (all calls to xPhraseFirst() set iCol to -1).
**
** xPhraseNext()
**   See xPhraseFirst above.
**
** xPhraseFirstColumn()
**   This function and xPhraseNextColumn() are similar to the xPhraseFirst()
**   and xPhraseNext() APIs described above. The difference is that instead
**   of iterating through all instances of a phrase in the current row, these
**   APIs are used to iterate through the set of columns in the current row
**   that contain one or more instances of a specified phrase. For example:
**
**       Fts5PhraseIter iter;
**       int iCol;
**       for(pApi->xPhraseFirstColumn(pFts, iPhrase, &iter, &iCol);
**           iCol>=0;
**           pApi->xPhraseNextColumn(pFts, &iter, &iCol)
**       ){
**         // Column iCol contains at least one instance of phrase iPhrase
**       }
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" option. If the FTS5 table is created with either
**   "detail=none" "content=" option (i.e. if it is a contentless table),
**   then this API always iterates through an empty set (all calls to
**   xPhraseFirstColumn() set iCol to -1).
**
**   The information accessed using this API and its companion
**   xPhraseFirstColumn() may also be obtained using xPhraseFirst/xPhraseNext
**   (or xInst/xInstCount). The chief advantage of this API is that it is
**   significantly more efficient than those alternatives when used with
**   "detail=column" tables.
**
** xPhraseNextColumn()
**   See xPhraseFirstColumn above.

** CUSTOM AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
*************************************************************************/

/*************************************************************************
** CUSTOM TOKENIZERS
**
** Applications may also register custom tokenizer types. A tokenizer
** is registered by providing fts5 with a populated instance of the
** following structure. All structure methods must be defined, setting
** any member of the fts5_tokenizer struct to NULL leads to undefined
** behaviour. The structure methods are expected to function as follows:
**
** xCreate:
**   This function is used to allocate and initialize a tokenizer instance.
**   A tokenizer instance is required to actually tokenize text.
**
**   The first argument passed to this function is a copy of the (void*)
**   pointer provided by the application when the fts5_tokenizer object
**   was registered with FTS5 (the third argument to xCreateTokenizer()).
**   The second and third arguments are an array of nul-terminated strings
**   containing the tokenizer arguments, if any, specified following the
**   tokenizer name as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used
**   to create the FTS5 table.
**
**   The final argument is an output variable. If successful, (*ppOut)
**   should be set to point to the new tokenizer handle and SQLITE_OK
**   returned. If an error occurs, some value other than SQLITE_OK should
**   be returned. In this case, fts5 assumes that the final value of *ppOut
**   is undefined.
**
** xDelete:
**   This function is invoked to delete a tokenizer handle previously
**   allocated using xCreate(). Fts5 guarantees that this function will
**   be invoked exactly once for each successful call to xCreate().
**
** xTokenize:
**   This function is expected to tokenize the nText byte string indicated
**   by argument pText. pText may or may not be nul-terminated. The first
**   argument passed to this function is a pointer to an Fts5Tokenizer object
**   returned by an earlier call to xCreate().
**
**   The second argument indicates the reason that FTS5 is requesting
**   tokenization of the supplied text. This is always one of the following
**   four values:
**
**   <ul><li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_DOCUMENT</b> - A document is being inserted into
**            or removed from the FTS table. The tokenizer is being invoked to
**            determine the set of tokens to add to (or delete from) the
**            FTS index.
**
**       <li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY</b> - A MATCH query is being executed
**            against the FTS index. The tokenizer is being called to tokenize
**            a bareword or quoted string specified as part of the query.
**
**       <li> <b>(FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY | FTS5_TOKENIZE_PREFIX)</b> - Same as
**            FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY, except that the bareword or quoted string is
**            followed by a "*" character, indicating that the last token
**            returned by the tokenizer will be treated as a token prefix.
**
**       <li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_AUX</b> - The tokenizer is being invoked to
**            satisfy an fts5_api.xTokenize() request made by an auxiliary
**            function. Or an fts5_api.xColumnSize() request made by the same
**            on a columnsize=0 database.
**   </ul>
**
**   For each token in the input string, the supplied callback xToken() must
**   be invoked. The first argument to it should be a copy of the pointer
**   passed as the second argument to xTokenize(). The third and fourth
**   arguments are a pointer to a buffer containing the token text, and the
**   size of the token in bytes. The 4th and 5th arguments are the byte offsets
**   of the first byte of and first byte immediately following the text from
**   which the token is derived within the input.
**
**   The second argument passed to the xToken() callback ("tflags") should
**   normally be set to 0. The exception is if the tokenizer supports
**   synonyms. In this case see the discussion below for details.
**
**   FTS5 assumes the xToken() callback is invoked for each token in the
**   order that they occur within the input text.
**
**   If an xToken() callback returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, then
**   the tokenization should be abandoned and the xTokenize() method should
**   immediately return a copy of the xToken() return value. Or, if the
**   input buffer is exhausted, xTokenize() should return SQLITE_OK. Finally,
**   if an error occurs with the xTokenize() implementation itself, it
**   may abandon the tokenization and return any error code other than
**   SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_DONE.
**
** SYNONYM SUPPORT
**
**   Custom tokenizers may also support synonyms. Consider a case in which a
**   user wishes to query for a phrase such as "first place". Using the
**   built-in tokenizers, the FTS5 query 'first + place' will match instances
**   of "first place" within the document set, but not alternative forms
**   such as "1st place". In some applications, it would be better to match
**   all instances of "first place" or "1st place" regardless of which form
**   the user specified in the MATCH query text.
**
**   There are several ways to approach this in FTS5:
**
**   <ol><li> By mapping all synonyms to a single token. In this case, using
**            the above example, this means that the tokenizer returns the
**            same token for inputs "first" and "1st". Say that token is in
**            fact "first", so that when the user inserts the document "I won
**            1st place" entries are added to the index for tokens "i", "won",
**            "first" and "place". If the user then queries for '1st + place',
**            the tokenizer substitutes "first" for "1st" and the query works
**            as expected.
**
**       <li> By querying the index for all synonyms of each query term
**            separately. In this case, when tokenizing query text, the
**            tokenizer may provide multiple synonyms for a single term
**            within the document. FTS5 then queries the index for each
**            synonym individually. For example, faced with the query:
**
**   <codeblock>
**     ... MATCH 'first place'</codeblock>
**
**            the tokenizer offers both "1st" and "first" as synonyms for the
**            first token in the MATCH query and FTS5 effectively runs a query
**            similar to:
**
**   <codeblock>
**     ... MATCH '(first OR 1st) place'</codeblock>
**
**            except that, for the purposes of auxiliary functions, the query
**            still appears to contain just two phrases - "(first OR 1st)"
**            being treated as a single phrase.
**
**       <li> By adding multiple synonyms for a single term to the FTS index.
**            Using this method, when tokenizing document text, the tokenizer
**            provides multiple synonyms for each token. So that when a
**            document such as "I won first place" is tokenized, entries are
**            added to the FTS index for "i", "won", "first", "1st" and
**            "place".
**
**            This way, even if the tokenizer does not provide synonyms
**            when tokenizing query text (it should not - to do so would be
**            inefficient), it doesn't matter if the user queries for
**            'first + place' or '1st + place', as there are entries in the
**            FTS index corresponding to both forms of the first token.
**   </ol>
**
**   Whether it is parsing document or query text, any call to xToken that
**   specifies a <i>tflags</i> argument with the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED bit
**   is considered to supply a synonym for the previous token. For example,
**   when parsing the document "I won first place", a tokenizer that supports
**   synonyms would call xToken() 5 times, as follows:
**
**   <codeblock>
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "i",                      1,  0,  1);
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "won",                    3,  2,  5);
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "first",                  5,  6, 11);
**       xToken(pCtx, FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED, "1st", 3,  6, 11);
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "place",                  5, 12, 17);
**</codeblock>
**
**   It is an error to specify the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED flag the first time
**   xToken() is called. Multiple synonyms may be specified for a single token
**   by making multiple calls to xToken(FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED) in sequence.
**   There is no limit to the number of synonyms that may be provided for a
**   single token.
**
**   In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach. It does not add
**   extra data to the FTS index or require FTS5 to query for multiple terms,
**   so it is efficient in terms of disk space and query speed. However, it
**   does not support prefix queries very well. If, as suggested above, the
**   token "first" is substituted for "1st" by the tokenizer, then the query:
**
**   <codeblock>
**     ... MATCH '1s*'</codeblock>
**
**   will not match documents that contain the token "1st" (as the tokenizer
**   will probably not map "1s" to any prefix of "first").
**
**   For full prefix support, method (3) may be preferred. In this case,
**   because the index contains entries for both "first" and "1st", prefix
**   queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly. However, because
**   extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space
**   within the database.
**
**   Method (2) offers a midpoint between (1) and (3). Using this method,
**   a query such as '1s*' will match documents that contain the literal
**   token "1st", but not "first" (assuming the tokenizer is not able to
**   provide synonyms for prefixes). However, a non-prefix query like '1st'
**   will match against "1st" and "first". This method does not require
**   extra disk space, as no extra entries are added to the FTS index.
**   On the other hand, it may require more CPU cycles to run MATCH queries,
**   as separate queries of the FTS index are required for each synonym.
**
**   When using methods (2) or (3), it is important that the tokenizer only
**   provide synonyms when tokenizing document text (method (2)) or query
**   text (method (3)), not both. Doing so will not cause any errors, but is
**   inefficient.
